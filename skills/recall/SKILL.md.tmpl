# Recall from Reintersect

Call the `SearchMemories` tool with the user's question as `query`. In Codex,
for a question about the current checkout, pass its git remote's `owner/repo`
as `repository`. In other hosts, leave `repository` unset so the plugin fills
it in from the git remote.

Report the facts as answers, with their dates when the date matters. If nothing
comes back, say so plainly instead of guessing, and do not invent memory ids.
